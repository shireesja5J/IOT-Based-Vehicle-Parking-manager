# IOT-Based-Vehicle-Parking-manager
Introduction
In the face of rising vehicle numbers and limited parking space, especially in densely populated areas, traditional parking systems struggle with inefficiency. The proposed project presents an IoT-based solution that optimizes parking space usage, reduces congestion, and provides real-time updates on parking slot availability. Using sensors, microcontrollers, and communication modules, this system allows for effective space management in various settings, such as apartments and commercial spaces, by updating users on slot availability through an LCD display and a web interface.
Scope and Purpose
The project encompasses both hardware and software development, integrating sensors and automated entry/exit systems to facilitate seamless parking. It aims to reduce operational costs by automating processes, enhance user experience through real-time data, and support sustainable urban development by reducing traffic congestion and emissions.

Features:
Key features include:
Real-Time Monitoring: Sensors detect vehicle presence and relay slot availability to users.
Automated Entry/Exit: Barriers and ticketing systems streamline access, including license plate recognition.
Payment Integration: Offers multiple payment methods, including contactless options.
Data Analytics: Tracks usage for optimized management and predicts future demand.
Scalability and Security: Designed to grow and adapt to different settings, with security measures in place for data protection.
Literature Survey
Existing IoT-enabled parking solutions leverage sensors like RFID and ultrasonic, providing real-time updates through mobile apps. The project explores future developments in AI-driven analytics for space optimization and eco-friendly designs with energy-efficient components.


System Design:
The system's architecture includes:
Microcontroller (e.g., AT89S52) for data processing.
Sensors (ultrasonic, infrared, magnetic) to detect vehicles.
GPRS Modem for web updates.
LCD Display at the entrance showing real-time slot availability.
